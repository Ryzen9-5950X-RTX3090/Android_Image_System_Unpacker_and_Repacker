# Guide for repack   
 
_Read this only in github for better view,_
_Repack "may or may not" work with all ROMs_
_This guide is not for official or Stock ROMs_ 
_and I don't think I will be able to provide any repack GUIDE for NOUGHT(or try below method if it works)_

## INFORMATION 

  _If you are using cyanogenmod ROM, you may find something in the updater-script, That is **"if range_sha1(........."** this executs in the script after extraction of system.new.dat to the **"system partition"**, which verifies **SAH-1** values of the system.new.dat, if the values are the same, the scripts succeeds and the flashing completes, if not, then the script returns 
   **"abort("system partition has unexpected non-zero contents after OTA update");"**.
  This problem can be solved by changing the old values of the system.new.dat with the current one and here is how to do it._

**NOTE**
* **"if range_sha1(........."**  _a line found in the updater-script of android 6.x ROMs_
* **SHA-1** (Secure Hash Algorithm **1**)
* **system partition** _partition where your OTA flashes files_
* **If your updater-script does not contain the above lines, then don't follow this guide, simply just replace your old files with the recently created ones (old-files=system.new.dat, system.transfer.list)** 

## Download these for further need

  * Extractor.bat

  * ROM (with file_contexts, or it will be useless)

  * For nought try to convert file_contexts.bin(binary file) to file_contexts(readable file), for conversion tool search XDA

  * ZIP sign - already included in extractor

    (I hope that you get it)

* So the system.transfer.list and the updater-script has a link of "**SAH-1**" and "**transfer**" commands
* Now change this into right, after repack you have three files 
```
   system.new.dat
   system.transfer.list
   "sha1_system.txt" which contains sha1 check of system.new.dat
   
```
* **NOTE**:- **transfer** commands means numbers beside "new" & "zero" in system.transfer.list, refer to xpirit guide
 
## Let's repack ROM
 
* First open Extractor.bat

* Choose option "**2 Repack system.new.dat**"
 
* Choose **1 (manual mode)** --> **Repack ( file_contexts is required)**
 
* Copy your sub folders for example:- addon.d, app, bin, fonts, framework, buile.prop, etc., to system folder (this message will also displayed in the extractor).
   
* Then place the **"file_contexts"** beside the system folder
   
### Some info. on ROM zip 
* A "CUSTOM" ROM ZIP CONTAINS:
```

*   system                (FOLDER)
   
*   META-INF              (FOLDER)
   
*   install               (FOLDER)
   
*   system.transfer.list  (FILE)
   
*   system.patch.dat      (FILE)
   
*   system.new.dat        (FILE)
   
*   file_contexts         (FILE)
   
*   boot.img              (FILE)
   
```
_(In the Stock ROM, there may be more files that are present)_

   **(FOR MARSHMALLOW AN LOLLIPOP)**  If you unable to find the (file_contexts) in the zip file, then extract the ramdisk from the boot.img
   and look for the "file_contexts" inside the ramdisk folder (search XDA for methods) _or_ try to explore your **ROM/device_source**

   _IMP : Do not use other "file_contexts" or dummy "file_contexts", because, it can cause the device to bootloop_ 
 
* Hit enter if you have done above 
 
* The extractor creates three files as output :-
 ```  
   system.new.dat
   system.transfer.list
   sha1_system.txt      -->  A new fresh **SHA-1** value of system.new.dat
 ```
 * Now copy the system.new.dat & the system.transfer.list to the ROM folder
 
 * Open the system.transfer.list :-
 
### In my case it (system.transfer.list) looks like this
```

* **You can clearly point out the difference between the _INITIAL_ updater-script (see start of the guide) and the _FINAL_ upater-script (above)**

* The both "range_sha1" line in the **INITIAL updater-script** and the **FINAL updater-script** differs.

* Also in the final script, both the "**SHA-1**" values become equal to each other, and their transfer commands values becomes equal as well.
 (refer to the xpirit guide for the transfer commands)

* That's all, save the updater-script, repack the ROM to the ZIP (Use 7-zip) and sign xyz_ROM.zip (optional) for the official Recovery, for TWRP do not sign the file, disable zip signing from the settings of TWRP.

* Then flash it, and wait for 5 minutes for the device to boot. If it works, then you're good to go.

**I hope though you got it**

**_And yes if you think this method is useless then please don't use it, I have tried my best to write this guide for the
